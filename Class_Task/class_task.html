                <span class="txt3">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
                    more so,
                    in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</span><br><br>
                    <small class="txt4">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</small>
